Welcome to my **Data Analyst / Analytics Engineer Portfolio** repository! This portfolio showcases my skills in data analysis, data processing, and visualization through hands-on showcases.

I’m a data expert with over 10 years of experience in data preparation, transformation, modeling, and visualization. I work with tools like dbt, SQL, BigQuery, Looker, Looker Studio, Tableau, and Python to build efficient workflows and deliver insights that matter.

I’ve worked across platforms — Snowflake, MS SQL Server, Sybase IQ, PostgreSQL, Excel, and Google Sheets — and adapt quickly to new environments.

I created this portfolio to demonstrate how I work with data, since most of my real-world projects are under NDA. Here you'll find examples of the approaches and solutions I typically use.

Feel free to explore the showcases — and reach out if you’d like to connect.
