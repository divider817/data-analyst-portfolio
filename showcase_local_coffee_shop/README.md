# Showcase: Local Coffee Shop Analysis

This showcase demonstrates my ability to use **Google BigQuery** and **Looker Studio** to analyze and visualize data for a local coffee shop. The project focuses on identifying trends, improving customer engagement, and optimizing business performance.

## Project Overview

### **Objective**
The goal of this analysis is to provide actionable insights to help the coffee shop:
- Understand customer behavior and sales trends.
- Optimize product offerings and inventory.
- Identify peak sales times and profitable items.

### **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project includes:
- Sales transactions (item, quantity, price, time, etc.).
- Customer demographics (age group, location, etc.).
- Product inventory and pricing.

The data was simulated and stored in **Google BigQuery** for querying and analysis.
